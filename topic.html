        INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
        <p>
            ASP.NET is a web application framework that is used to build dynamic and interactive web pages. It is a server-side technology that is designed and developed by Microsoft. It released on 5 Januart 2002 and is built on top of the .NET framework and it is used by developers to build web applications that are secure, scalable, and reliable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, it also provides developers with a rich set of features that enable them to build powerful and robust web applications. It supports a wide range of programming languages including C#, VB.NET, and F#. ASP.NET uses a modular architecture that allows developers to easily add or remove components as needed. It also provides a rich set of controls and libraries that make it easy to develop complex applications.

    <section id="Benefits">
        <h2>BENEFITS</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><em>Performance</em> - ASP.NET applications are optimised for performance and can handle large amounts of traffic with ease. This is because ASP.NET uses a compiled code model, which means that the code is compiled into a binary format that can be executed by the server. This makes the code run faster and reduces the load on the server.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Security</em> - A number of features are provided by ASP.net to help developers build secure web applications. For example, it provides support for authentication and authorization, which enables developers to control access to different parts of the application. It also provides support for encryption, which helps to protect sensitive data.</li>

                </table>
            </aside>     
            <li><em>Debugging & Diagnostics</em> - Developers are also provided with a rich set of tools for debugging and troubleshooting their applications. It provides a number of debugging tools that help developers identify and fix issues in their code. It also provides detailed error messages that help developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it.</li>
